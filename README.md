Drunk Driving Test Game

Controls:

W and S key - for forward and backwards movement.
A and D key - for turning left and right.
Space key   - for using the brakes.


Goal:

Reach the end of the course and touching as few cones as possible. 
You start with 100 points, decreasing by one for each cone touched. 
There will be some cones that are not worth any points and will only serve to 
block you from moving forward. You must "unlock" them by touching the green
areas first. Level one will be the "control" stage. Level two will be the 
"drunk" stage. After level two, both scores will be presented to you for 
comparison.

Don't DUI.
